# Project 7 JavaScript Game Show app. 

## This project let's you play a phrase guessing game!


## INFO/ABOUT

The main component to making this project successful will be JavaScript. In this project I chose not to use JQuery and instead display regular JavaScript ability. 

Full disclosure: A CSS template was provided but I will still provide some custom CSS. 

As always this is a mobile-first responsive design.

I will document my progress, tasks completed and problem solving when I run into them. I will also leave notes where applicable.
